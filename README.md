# Convex-Hull-Problem


Implemented a recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm to solve the Convex Hull Issue. Created in C.

Program displays the hull points found as it traverses all points in the hull. 

Program also finds the shortest path between 2 (x, y) coordinates.

Example file is provided for Convex Hull points file format.
